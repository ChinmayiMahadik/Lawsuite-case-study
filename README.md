Exploratory Data Analysis using Lawsuit data set

We have used R programming for EDA. R programming is widely used among statisticians and data miners and it has many useful packages which enable use to generate summary and visualization of the data.


We used packages like tidyverse, funModeling , Hmisc for data summary.
For data visualization in form of graphs, we used package call ggplot. We also use Microsoft Excel for interactive graphs.

Process used in EDA:
1) Data cleaning - Finding and handling missing and incorrect data. 
2) Handling outliers.
3) Data summarization
4) Inference from univariant , bivariant and multivariat charts.
